# Library app

- A web application that allows users to manage a personal book collection with the ability to track read books, switch between light and dark modes, and more.
- I built this to demonstrate what I learned about DOM manipulation.

## Features:

- allows a user to add/remove books appended to the DOM.  
- light/dark mode functionality.
- disables the checkbox upon reading book (since a book cannot be "unread".)

## Future Features:

- each button will have an id number thats incremented, 1,2,3,4,5 even if the 4th button was removed.  
- the text contents for the ids would still be 1, 2, 3, 4** for instance, fetch book images/purchase links methods.  
- Add book wishlisting functionality.
- Add a book read counter rather than binary read property (if read more than once.)  
- UI/UX improvements.  
- Add a method to update added books.

## Technologies used:

- **HTML**  
- **CSS**  
- **JavaScript**  
- **Git Bash**  
- **VS Code**  
- **GitHub**
